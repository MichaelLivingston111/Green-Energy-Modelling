# Green Energy Modelling
A series of machine learning projects relating to forecasting energy consumption and green power production. These algorithms are intended for use in data-driven decarbonization consulting. 

# Project #1: Predicting solar panel power output across North America.
This project aims to predict the horizontal photovoltaic power output from a variety of different solar farms across North America using only a suite of commonly reported environmental variables. This approach avoids the problems asscociated with obtaining complex and unreliable data types, such as solar irradiance data. As such, it can be applied across a wide range of locations. It contains two files in which the machine learning frameworks are compiled. in "Solar" the whole model is complied based on the variables from the dataset. In "Solar applied" the algorithm is modified so it is only dependent on variables that are not location specific. Thus, the algorithm can be expanded into a variety of regions.

# Project #2: Energy use forecasting:
 This project estimates the energy efficiency, in terms of heating and cooling loads, for a variety of different commerical building types. It uses features such as orientation, surface area, relative compactness, glazing area etc. to predict energy efficiency. Using deep learning algorithms and sequential neural networks, this code accurately predicts energy efficiency to within 3 Kilowatts/h.
