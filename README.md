# Green Energy Modelling
A series of machine learning projects relating to forecasting energy consumption and green power.

# Project #1: Energy use forecasting:
 This project estimates the energy efficiency, in terms of heating and cooling loads, for a variety of different commerical building types. It uses features such as orientation, surface area, relative compactness, glazing area etc. to predict energy efficiency. Using deep learning algorithms and sequential neural networks, this code accurately predicts energy efficiency to within 3 Kilowatts/h.

# Project #2: Solar energy forecasting across North Amercia:
This project aims to predict the horizontal photovoltaic power output from a variety of different solar farms across North America without the use of irradiance data. It will also highhlight new areas of potential efficient solar energy capture. Much work still to be done.
